# Crab Game


Simple C++ game created using a custom provided game engine library as part of a C++ programming module

Parts of this project are provided by the Lecturer, so look for files either commented or with 

```#include "Psyjl16Engine.h"```

The game itself is rather basic, and doesn't focus on things like graphics or performance, instead focussing on the specifics of writting C++ programs
